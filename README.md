# OpenVetSimScripts
A repository for file management scripts made for OpenVetSim

## Introduction
These scripts were designed for use with the OpenVetSim project made by Cornell. They were created to solve a simple problem: OpenVetSim keeps it's video files on the computer's hard drive, and there is no way to change the location.

These scripts are designed to be run as systemd services on linux (the VetSim pc runs Ubuntu)
